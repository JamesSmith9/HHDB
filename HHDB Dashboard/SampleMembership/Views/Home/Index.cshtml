The <b>Hubbard House Survivors Survey Analysis System</b> is a web based application that will allow the administrators to consolidate survey data, to allow for analysis of victim needs and the services currently being provided to them. 
<br />
This system includes a method to input data, view/edit it post-input, and output the data into several graphs and charts.
<br />
The end goal of this system is to be able to help victims more effectively.
<br />
This was created by UNF students named below, and intended for use by Hubbard House employees.
